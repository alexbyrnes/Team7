# Team7

Angela: 
She's a professional, a millennial, knowledgeable about current events, very connected on social media. 
Like any good, affluent millenial, she is regularly on a computer, either for work or personal reasons; however, she also has a smart phone and/or tablet, which she regularly uses to check emails, text friends and family, browse the web, get directions, online dating apps (so she is familiar with swiping left/right), finding out which tapas restaurant has the best happy hour - and, of course, to read news.
She wants news that makes sure she isn't missing anything (variety) and news she cares about (relevance).
Work keeps her busy during the day, social life keeps her busy during the evenings and weekends. She likes to optimize her free time and multi-task.
Angela is the super-user. She just doesn't know it yet.

Angela's problems are two-fold: time and relevance.
Time: 

Three situations she uses to catch up on news, with limited time: coffee break at work (10 minutes); commute on the metro (30 minutes); cardio at the gym (1 hour)

This app: 
When users first sign up, they choose preferred topics of news as a starting point. The app learns their habits and preferences over time (recommendation engine), while not refusing to give up on crucial news of the day. 
Upon each use, user can enter the amount of time they have to browse the news.
Depending on the amount of time they enter, the app pulls articles of various lengths and topics to give the user a well-rounded experience.
The app provides news based on what's important and what she likes. She can select which articles to read. 
She can swipe left or right to show whether she liked or disliked the article after reading it. The app learns her preferences this way.
The starting point of this app is the average reading speed of 200 words per minute. The app learns her reading speed to tailor which article to provide, based on the length of the article.
As she uses the app, the first thing she notices is the grouping of articles, by the time it would take to read them.
Each grouping presents a variety of news articles tailored to her reading speed and how much free time she entered.

Wish list:
Saving and sharing to pre-existing saving platforms like Pocket, Pinterest, Evernote and sharing platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or email. Ultimately, the app would learn the types of social events and local news she's interested in, and pull news coverage or event calendars from news outlets to tell her of events coming up/that happened.
