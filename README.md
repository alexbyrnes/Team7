Angela: 
She's a professional, a millennial, knowledgeable about current events, very connected on social media. 
She wants news that makes sure she isn't missing anything (variety) and news she cares about (relevance).
Work keeps her busy during the day, social life keeps her busy during the evenings and weekends. She likes to optimize her free time and multi-task.
She uses online dating apps, so she is familiar with swiping left/right and is used to getting options tailored to her.
Angela is the super-user.

Three situations she uses to catch up on news, with limited time: coffee break at work (10 minutes); commute on the metro (30 minutes); cardio at the gym (1 hour)
