Angela: <br>
Her Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100010072053810&__nodl<br>
She's a professional, a millennial, knowledgeable about current events, connected on social media. She likes to optimize her free time and multi-task.<br>
Like any good, affluent millenial, she is regularly on a computer, either for work or personal reasons; however, she also has a smart phone and/or tablet, which she regularly uses to check emails, text friends and family, browse the web, get directions, online dating apps (so she is familiar with swiping left/right), finding out which tapas restaurant has the best happy hour - and, of course, to read news.<br>
Angela is the power-user. She just doesn't know it yet.

Angela's interests include: politics, women's issues, satirical comedy shows, wine. Over time, the app will learn her preferences and tailor articles for her. 

The app addresses Angela's two-fold needs: She wants news that makes sure she isn't missing anything (variety) and news she cares about (relevance).<br>

Three situations she uses to catch up on news, with limited time: <br>
-coffee break at work (10 minutes)<br>
-commute on the metro (30 minutes)<br>
-cardio at the gym (1 hour)

This app: <br>
-User signs up, chooses preferred topics of news. The app learns the user's habits and preferences over time (recommendation engine), while still providing must-know news of the day. <br>
-Upon each use, user can enter the amount of time they have to browse the news. Adjusting to the amount of time  entered, the app pulls articles of various lengths and topics to give the user a well-rounded experience. <br>
-The app provides news based on what's important and what she likes. She can select which articles to read. <br>
-She can swipe left or right to show whether she liked or disliked the article after reading it. The app learns her preferences this way.<br>
-The starting point of this app is the average reading speed of 200 words per minute. The app learns her reading speed to tailor which article to provide, based on the length of the article.<br>

Wish list:<br>
-Saving (Pocket, Pinterest, Instapaper, Evernote) and sharing (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, email). <br>
-Ultimately, the app would learn the types of social events and local news she's interested in, and pull news coverage or event calendars from news outlets to tell her of events coming up/that happened. <br>
-Settings: Theme, reminders (the app learns around what time of day you use it), language, location
